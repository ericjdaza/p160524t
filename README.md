The R script "p160524t.R" generates the propensity-score-based results found in the article "Likelihood of Unemployed Smokers vs Nonsmokers Attaining Reemployment in a One-Year Observational Study" by Judith J. Prochaska et al (2016). NOTE: The two sections with the header "##### Path and variable names: Define." must be uncommented and populated for the script to run properly.
